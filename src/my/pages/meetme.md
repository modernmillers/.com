  Hey, Lauren here! 
  
  So glad you’ve made it! Welcome to my blog, <span class="brand small"><span class="alt-font alt-color">{ thoroughly }</span> Modern Millers</span>. Let me start by telling you a little about myself. 
  I am a San Diego native (9 generations to be exact!), graced with gorgeous weather year round, and can’t imagine living anywhere else. 
  I grew up in a large family, with <span class="weight200">four amazing older brothers</span>, each of whom attributed to my personality and identity.

        <p class="polaroid">The Brothers</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  I have worked as a full time nanny, while going to school for the past 8 years. 
  After taking the slow track to get my associates degree followed by a <span class="weight200">Bachelors Degree in Human Development</span>, 
  I decided to go back to school one more time (I guess I just like writing papers!). Third times a charm?
  
  I have a passion for <span class="weight200">sewing, crafting and reading</span>. I am becoming more like my mother with each passing day! 
  Growing up, I was the kid who went to quilting camp at Quilt in a Day (San Marcos, Ca) instead of sleep-away camp with friends. 
  I was also the kid who gifted books for birthdays, so you can imagine my popularity level…
  
  I have started a new chapter in my life, and <span class="weight200">I couldn’t be more excited about the future</span>. 
  I am newly engaged to the man of my dreams, Mr. Miller, 
  who took me to Paris and asked for my hand in marriage (<a href="/my/posts/life/paris">read about it in this post</a>)! 
  We plan on tying the knot in the new year, and watching our life unfold in front of our eyes.

Keep Calm, and Read On!
