Paint a glitter-dusted pinecone in Under 5 minutes!

<br/>

Thanksgiving is almost here! I love everything that comes along with this holiday. The fall weather (although living in San Diego, this doesn’t really happen), family, food, and decorations! In the years past the hosting has always fallen on my parents or aunts and uncles, so decorating was never in my scope of duties for the holiday. Until now! This year, I am hosting the second annual joint family Thanksgiving, so it is my duty to not only plan food and fun, but also make the house look festive for the holiday. 

<br/>

When I think of fall and Thanksgiving, the first thing that comes to my mind (other than a cornucopia) is a pinecone! Such a simple piece of nature can make any table or mantle turn into a festive backdrop. There are so many things you can do to change the look of a pinecone, depending on what you are using it for. In my case, I want to use them as a center piece for our table. This is easy to do, and I will show you how!

Although pinecones are beautiful and unique naturally, painting them adds a whole new flair, adding fall colors to your table, while still leaving a natural aspect.

<br/>

Start by choosing a few paint colors you want to use (I chose 3), and get out some paintbrushes. Start painting at the bottom of the pinecone working your way to the top. Paint about a ¼ inch from the tip of each scale of the pinecone.

Once you have finished painting the tips of the pinecone, while the paint is still wet, lightly dust with glitter of your choosing.

<br/>
	
There you have it! A super simple, and fun way to spice up a pinecone! Invite a friend over to help, or entertain a child, or paint in solitude.

Happy painting!
