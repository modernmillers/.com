Just last month, my fiancé Mr. Miller turned 30! To celebrate this momentous event, I wanted to do something extra special for him. I went a little Pinterest crazy trying to find a creative way to show him how much he means to me, while incorporating the number thirty, of course! 

<br/>

During my search, I found so many cute ideas for 30th birthdays, like 30 lollipops that read “30 sucks”, “30 ‘Reeses’ I love you” with something you love about him written on the back of each candy, and 30 balloons with pictures or reasons you love him. Don’t get me wrong, these all are such fun ideas, but I was looking for something that would last longer than the few days it would take to eat 30 Reeses candies between the two of us (Don’t judge!), or the time it would take the helium to diffuse out of the balloons. It became apparent to me that I was going to have to get creative here. 

<br/>

If you know anything about Mr. Miller, its that he is a romantic and almost always goes out of his way to make memories that will last a life time. MEMORIES! That’s it!  I have beautiful memories of the last four years of our relationship, and I most certainly have 30! 

<br/>

In the end, I made 30 mounted photos, each in it’s own envelope with a memory to go with the picture. Incase you are having my same issue with finding the perfect gift to make, here’s how I made them:

What you need:
- 30 photos, which correlate with memories
- Colored cardstock (1/2 -1 in. larger than photo)
- Washi tape or glue (to adhere photo to cardstock)
- Envelopes
- Stamps, stickers, or any other decorative items you wish to use
- Colored paper
- Ribbon or yarn

I started the process by cutting out colored paper (in my case, I chose red) into about 2x3 rectangles. These will be where the memories are written for each photo.

After all 30 memories are written onto the colored paper, now its time to attach the photos to the cardstock of your choice. I used tape curls, which worked well, but glue or cute washi tape can be used just the same. Remember to leave a nice, even border around the edge of the photo to give it a more professional look.

Embellish each envelope with stamps and/or stickers, tie together with ribbon or yarn, and there you have it! A birthday gift that will last a lifetime!

Happy Memories.

See ya soon,
