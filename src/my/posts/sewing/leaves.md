Easy sewn felt leaves tutorial (great for Thanksgiving d√©cor!)

{Supplies needed}
- felt (a variation of Fall colors)
- Leaf cutouts (You can either draw and cut them out yourself, or find a template online)
- Scissors
- Pins
- Thread (it can be coordinating, or not. Which ever you prefer.)
- Sewing machine

<span class="light-weight">Step #1:</span> With your cut out leaf templates, pin them to the felt for easier and more efficient cutting. Carefully cut the leaves out.

<span class="light-weight">Step #2:</span> Once you have all your leaves cut out (I did 16 leaves total, 4 of each color), take them over to the sewing machine.

<span class="light-weight">Step #3:</span> This is where it can get a little tricky, if you are less experienced on a machine. I started from the bottom stem of the leaf and made my way to the top tip of the leaf. From here, I lifted my foot up (needle in the down position!) and rotated, made my way back down on the same sewn line, until I came across a point to add a side vein of the leave. I lifted my foot up once again and rotated to sew the vein, then pivoted again to go back to the middle, repeating myself until I was back at the bottom stem where I started.

<span class="light-weight">Step #4:</span> Snip the loose threads, and you have yourself a cute fall leaf. After all the leaves are sewn, you can put them in a bowl as a centerpiece, or string them together as a garland, the possibilities are endless!

This project is so easy and cheap to do, not to mention they start to look like real fall leaves in the end as the thread pulls on the felt ever so slightly, giving it a wrinkled look!

I hope you enjoy this project as much as I did! Happy Fall!

See ya soon,
