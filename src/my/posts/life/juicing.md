Staying healthy is essential

Fresh juice provides us with minerals, vitamins, essential fatty acids, carbohydrates, proteins and much more. All of these factors are vital to maintaining good health. You will find that when you make fresh juice a daily part of your diet, you will have increased energy, a glowing complexion, strengthened immune system, stronger bones and a reduced risk of disease. It is recommended that you drink at least 16 ounces of freshly squeezed juice each day.

Although eating fruits and vegetables in their natural state does provide us with a substantial amount of vitamins and minerals, we only obtain the maximum benefits from them when they are juiced. Much of their goodness is locked in the fiber which is expelled from the body. When we juice the fruits and vegetables, their goodness is released from the fiber and we are able to drink their highly concentrated nutrients which are then able to enter our bloodstream very quickly. Fiber is essential to health, so be sure to continue eating raw fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains in conjunction with fresh juices to gain the maximum amount of nutritional value from what you eat. Very few people eat enough raw fruits and vegetables. Juicing provides a quick and easy way to increase your consumption of these foods, and is recommended in addition to a high fiber diet.

There are many bottled juices available on the market today. One of the problems with these is that many of their valuable nutrients are lost during the bottling process. If you make your own juice and drink it fresh, you will have control over the quality of the fruits and vegetables you are consuming, and in many cases you will save money. Your local Farmer's Market is a great place to buy fresh, inexpensive and often organic produce.

See ya soon,
