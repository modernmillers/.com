Last December, Mr. Miller and I traveled abroad to Europe (his first time, my second) to spend our holiday as a couple of almost four years, in a beautiful, exciting new place. We really wanted to go on a cruise, but after a little bit of research, we realized the number of trips in the middle of winter were quite minimal (go figure!). Alas, we decided to fly into Paris for a few days, head on over to Rome, and end in Barcelona. The perfect European vacation!

After our 11 hour flight (!!!), we boarded our pre-booked shuttle (to anyone traveling in the future, I highly recommend booking all shuttles in advance!) to our hotel, Le Lavoisier. The exterior of the building was a picturesque French hotel, with a stoop entrance in a small alleyway, with large windows peering into the Christmas tree and warm lighting inside. A wonderfully sweet and accommodating French woman, checked us in and sent us on our way to explore the quaint hotel to find our room. We found our room quickly, given the small size of the hotel, and put our things down. Mr. Miller was excited to get out and explore, so he told me to get ready while he went down stairs to ask the kind French woman a question. At this point I didn’t think it odd that he needed to inquire about something, we were in a foreign country after all!

While parading through the beautiful city of Paris, we stopped in a convenient store to pick up a lock (Mr. Miller informed me it was to ensure his backpack was safely locked while walking around), and I was none the wiser. After our pit stop, we kept on walking the city aimlessly (or so I thought). We reached the Seine River, and walked along the water hand in hand. Mr. Miller reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a piece of gum to offer it to me. I took it, chewed it, and nearly spit it out! It was so hard and old! When I asked him why he had old gum in his pocket, he just shrugged. 

Ok, back to the story! Along our walk on the Seine River, we came across a bridge not like any other we had seen. This bridge was covered in locks! I had heard about such bridges where people profess or share their love with someone by locking a lock onto the bridge and throwing the key into the river. This symbolizes eternal love, since the key will never be retrieved again, and love will remain locked in your hearts forever. My mind started racing as we walked toward this unique bridge, “we just went to buy a lock”, “how did he know where this was?”, “why is it so windy”, “is there any room for more locks?”, “ why is everyone staring at me?!”. I was pulled out of my confusion as I look over to find Mr. Miller on one knee in front of me. Suddenly it all came together and everything made perfect sense! 

You can only guess what happened next. Mr. Miller asked for my hand in marriage and I graciously said yes! I was so humbled by this experience, I didn’t know what else to say, other than look at my ring and profess its beauty to my new husband-to-be (which was hidden the whole time in a gum packet, hence the offering of the gum!)

The rest of our time in Paris, and the rest of our journey in Europe was so memorable, but nothing could top that first night we shared.
