Costco is like childbirth, every trip is painful, but as soon as you leave that overcrowded parking lot, your memory is swiped clean. The next time you get into your car on a Saturday afternoon to head over to good ‘ole Costco, you can’t remember why you complained the whole way through last time, until you drive into that damned parking lot. 
	Incase your memory fails you, as mine does, here is a list of five reasons we all despise that dreary warehouse. Yet, despite all these reasons, we still can’t resist!

<span class="light-weight">1) The parking lot.</span> Driving around here, looking for a parking spot is like survival of the fittest, whoever gets to the man at the door first to flash their membership gets the biggest pack of scratchy toilet paper they could ask for! Not to mention the lucky winners leaving, with their oversized carts stuffed to the brim, they can barely see where they are going (either that or they just don’t care) I swear a woman magically appeared in the middle of the street the other day (one of us wasn’t paying attention, and it wasn’t me!). If there is a gas station, forget it!

<span class="light-weight">2) Methods of payment.</span> Cash, good. Debit, great. Check, okay (but let’s be honest, who carries those around!). Credit Card, hold it! “We only take American Express.” Say what?! From my years of experience in retail, taking an American Express card was like avoiding the plague (“Oooo, sorry.. We don’t take American Express”). If you own one, you know exactly what I’m talking about. Oh, and the food court outside? Cash only, go figure.

<span class="light-weight">3) Samples.</span> Okay, don’t get me wrong. I love samples as much as the next person, but when the person in front of you stops dead in their tracks to sample a whole grain seed cracker to purchase by the hundreds, the hype tends to diminish after the third or fourth bumper cart incident.

<span class="light-weight">4) Oversized carts.</span> These puppies are large and in charge. Not only can they fit the aforementioned toilet paper rolls, but I have also seen an occasional sleeping child. Pardon me for almost slamming into your cart with your sleeping beauty inside, as I turn the corner!

<span class="light-weight">5) Lines.</span> As soon as you’re done juggling the sample frenzy, and the bumper carts, and not to mention the realization of how much money you are about to spend, you take a sigh of relief because the worst part is over. Wrong! If you thought the lines to get a delicious sample were rough, now you’re in the big leagues. As soon as you get up to the conveyer belt, you better know what you’re doing. There is a system, people!

*Disclaimer: This is to be taken lightly. I frequently shop at Costco, and do not hold any of these things against them.


See ya soon,
